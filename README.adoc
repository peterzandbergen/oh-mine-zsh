= Oh Mine ZSH
Peter Zandbergen <peter.zandbergen@myhops.com>

This repo contains my .zshrc file plus references to instructions on how to install zsh and oh my zsh.

== Set up your system

*_zsh_* has a website, https://zsh.org[zsh.org], but you will not find a lot of useful information there.
A better place to find information on *_zsh_* is the github wiki of https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki[_oh my zsh_], which contains a load of plugins and themes for *_zsh_*, and directs you to https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH[the installation instructions].

=== Install zsh

On my Ubuntu based distro I used apt to install zsh.

[source,shell]
sudo apt install zsh

=== Install oh my zsh

You install *_oh my zsh_* with a shell script and curl.

[source,shell]
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Look on 
https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki#:~:text=of%20these%20commands%3A-,Method,-Command[*_oh my zsh_*]
 for installation instructions using `wget` or `fetch`.
